This repository contains a variety of useful data science/machine learning tutorials I've developed over time. Here's the current list:

- [animations of machine learning models for pedagogy](ml-animations)
- [deploying machine learning models with Amazon Sagemaker or Flask](ml-deploy-model)
- [image generation with VAEs and GANs](ml-image-generation)
- [supervised learning for time series data](ml-timeseries)
