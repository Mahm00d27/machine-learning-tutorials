    "This notebook demonstrates the use of Amazon SageMakerâ€™s implementation of the XGBoost algorithm to train and host a regression model. It uses the classic abalone dataset which, the original version of which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone). Briefly, the number of \"rings\" present in an abalone shell is a proxy for the age of the abalone (age [years] = rings + 1.5). We aim to predict the age of abalone based on eight physical measurements. The data provided in the tutorial has been modified from the original, namely, the \"Sex\" characteristic has been one-hot-encoded and the \"rings\" target variable has had 1.5 added to it to represent the abalone age in years.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is modified after the example provided by Amazon [here](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/xgboost_abalone/xgboost_abalone.ipynb). It has been significantly stripped down and modified to provide a bare minimum example illustrating how to build and deploy a model using SageMaker."
